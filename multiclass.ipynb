    "### **Problem Statement**: \n",
    "#### The task is to predict survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis given features.\n",
    "> Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data description is adapted from this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markuslill/s3e26-xgbclassifer) and the orignal data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/cirrhosis-patient-survival-prediction).\n",

    "| Variable Name | Role | Type | Encoding | Description | Missing Values |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| ID | ID | Int | drop | Unique identifier | No |\n",
    "| N_Days | Feature? | Int | numeric | Number of days between registration and the earlier of death(D), transplantation(CL), or being alive at the study analysis time in July 1986(C) | No |\n",
    "| Drug | Feature | Categorical | Binary | Type of drug: D-penicillamine or placebo. Type of medication may impact the effectiveness of treatment, thus affecting status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Age | Feature | Int | numeric | Age. Age could be related to disease progression; older patients may have a different status trajectory. | No |\n",
    "| Sex | Feature | Categorical | Binary | Gender: M (male) or F (female). Biological sex may influence disease patterns and response to treatment, thereby affecting status. | No |\n",
    "| Ascites | Feature | Categorical | Binary | Presence of ascites: N (No) or Y (Yes). The accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, often a sign of advanced liver disease, which could indicate a poorer status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Hepatomegaly | Feature | Categorical | Binary | Presence of hepatomegaly: N (No) or Y (Yes). Enlargement of the liver. If present, it might suggest more serious liver disease and potentially a poorer status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Spiders | Feature | Categorical | Binary | Presence of spiders: N (No) or Y (Yes). Spider angiomas are small, spider-like capillaries visible under the skin, associated with liver disease and could indicate a more advanced disease affecting status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Edema | Feature | Categorical | One-Hot | Presence of edema: N (no edema and no diuretic therapy for edema), S (edema present without diuretics, or edema resolved by diuretics), or Y (edema despite diuretic therapy). Swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues, often worsening the prognosis and indicating poorer status. | No |\n",
    "| Bilirubin | Feature | Continuous(Int) | numeric | Serum bilirubin. High levels can indicate liver dysfunction and may correlate with more advanced disease and poorer status. | No |\n",
    "| Cholesterol | Feature | Continous(Int)? | numeric | Serum cholesterol. While not directly related to liver function, abnormal levels can be associated with certain liver conditions and overall health status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Albumin | Feature | Continous(Int) | numeric | Low levels can be a sign of liver disease and can indicate a poorer status due to the liver's reduced ability to synthesize proteins. | No |\n",
    "| Copper | Feature | Int | numeric | Urine copper. Elevated in certain liver diseases (like Wilson's disease), and could affect status if levels are abnormally high. | Yes |\n",
    "| Alk_Phos | Feature | Continuous | numeric | Alkaline phosphatase. An enzyme related to the bile ducts; high levels might indicate blockage or other issues related to the liver. | Yes |\n",
    "| SGOT | Feature | Continuous | numeric | An enzyme that, when elevated, can indicate liver damage and could correlate with a worsening status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Triglycerides | Feature | Int | numeric | Triglycerides. Though mainly a cardiovascular risk indicator, they can be affected by liver function and, by extension, the status of the patient. | Yes |\n",
    "| Platelets | Feature | Int | numeric | Platelets per cubic. Low platelet count can be a result of advanced liver disease and can indicate a poorer status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Prothrombin | Feature | Int | numeric | Prothrombin time. A measure of how long it takes blood to clot. Liver disease can cause increased times, indicating poorer status. | Yes |\n",
    "| Stage | Feature | Categorical | Ordinal | UHistologic stage of disease (1, 2, 3, or 4). The stage of liver disease, which directly correlates with the patient's status - the higher the stage, the more serious the condition. | Yes |\n",
    "| Status | Target | Categorical | Label | C (censored) indicates the patient was alive at N_Days, CL indicates the patient was alive at N_Days due to liver a transplant, and D indicates the patient was deceased at N_Days | No |"
